# Aura Turbo MT5

## Description
This code represents the implementation of Aura Turbo MT5, a forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. Aura Turbo MT5 utilizes advanced technologies such as hyperparameter optimization, grid trading strategy, and deep machine learning to provide optimal forex trading with artificial intelligence.

The code consists of several functions that perform different tasks:

## Hyperparameter Optimization
The `HyperparameterOptimization()` function implements the hyperparameter optimization process. It fine-tunes constraints, weights, and learning rates to determine the best set of hyperparameters for the trading strategy.

## Grid Expert
The `GridExpert()` function implements the grid trading strategy. It utilizes a machine learning algorithm to make informed trading decisions based on market trends and indicators.

## Deep Machine Learning
The `DeepMachineLearning()` function incorporates deep machine learning techniques to analyze market trends, patterns, and indicators. This analysis helps in generating accurate trading signals.

## XAUUSD (GOLD) Performance
The `XAUUSDPerformance()` function conducts thorough testing and optimization specifically on the XAUUSD (GOLD) market. The goal is to ensure the stability and robustness of Aura Turbo MT5 in this particular market.

## Technical Specifications
The `TechnicalSpecifications()` function outlines the technical requirements and considerations for developing the code. It emphasizes the use of appropriate programming languages and frameworks compatible with the MT5 platform. It also highlights the need for an efficient and scalable code structure, proper error handling, code optimization, integration of necessary APIs and data sources, and implementation of secure authentication and data encryption mechanisms.

## Main function
The `OnStart()` function serves as the entry point for the code execution. It calls all the necessary functions in the order needed to achieve the desired trading performance. The functions called are `HyperparameterOptimization()`, `GridExpert()`, `DeepMachineLearning()`, `XAUUSDPerformance()`, and `TechnicalSpecifications()`.
